Customer segmentation is an effective tool for businesses to closely align their strategy and tactics with, and better target, their current and future customers. 
Every customer is different and every customer journey is different, so a single approach often isn’t going to work for all.

Customer segmentation is the process by which you divide your customers up based on common characteristics – such as demographics or behaviours, so your 
marketing team or sales team can reach out to those customers more effectively.

These customer segmentation groups can also be used to begin building a marketing persona or product user persona. This is because effective customer segmentation analysis 
is typically used to inform a brand’s messaging and positioning, helps organisations know what new products are services they might want to invest in, and uncovers ways to 
improve how the business sells. Because of this, marketing personas need to be closely aligned to those segments in order to be effective.

The “target persona” (or “marketing persona”) is, by definition, a personification of a specific customer segment so it’s not uncommon for businesses to create several personas 
to match the various customer segments they’ve created.But for that to happen, a business needs a robust set of customer segments to form a customer segmentation model.
